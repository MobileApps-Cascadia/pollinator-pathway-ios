# FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS

## Usability summary
Based on the usability studies on the high-fidelity prototype added a welcome screen to the registration flow with directions for how to register a new site.  We also fixed spacing and alignment consistency issues.  We adjusted the navigation by removing buttons on the landing page and utilizing the android bottom navigation.  We changed less important buttons to outlined instead of filled based on material design and changed the text in some buttons for clarity.  We also adjusted the background to make text boxes clearer.


## Monetization 
* Adding a storefront for farmers, community members, and other users to create listings and sell goods and services.
* Creating affiliate opportunities for storefront
* Creating referral bonuses for new members who set up a pollinator kit
* Relevant advertising (local honey, pollinator tools / equipment, services)

## MEASURING ENGAGEMENT
* New Users: Initially scanning QR code upon receipt and setup of pollinator kit, creating a new profile, and viewing other pollinator locations, member profiles, and offerings through the app.
* Existing Users: Using the app to communicate with other members, viewing other pollinator locations, editing profile information as needed, and interacting with administrators / owners / management
* Owners / Admins / Volunteers: Approving all incoming requests by new users to be added to the pathway, editing/deleting profiles as needed, and general maintenance.

## Stretch features

* Adding storefront for sale of pollinator related goods and services.
* Adding blog style board with new information and announcements.
* Adding volunteer opportunities.
* Adding Contact information.
* Add informational pages about various pollinators.
* Tools for identifying pollinators found at plantings.
